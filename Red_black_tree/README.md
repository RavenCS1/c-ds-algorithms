# Red-Black Tree

## Build from **this directory**

**CMake:**  
cmake -S . -B build  
cmake --build build  
cd build  
./Red_black_tree  

**Makefile (recommended - clean build):**  
make build-clean  
./Red_black_tree  

**`make build-clean` builds binary + removes .o files (only binary remains)**
